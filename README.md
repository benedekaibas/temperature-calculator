# temperature-calculator
A basic python code for calculating the temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius

![This is the formula that I used in my code](image.png)

This is the formula that I use for the code. 
With the formulas above I can switch degrees
between Fahrenheit and Celsius. 

The code has two stages:
1. The code ask for user input and then makes the calculation
2. The code knows the location you are at (it will take Meadville 
as the location, but then it can be changed) and makes the computation.
