# temperature-calculator
A basic python code for calculating the temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius

![This is the formula that I used in my code](image.png)

This is the formula that I use for the code. 
With the formulas above I can switch degrees
between Fahrenheit and Celsius. 

The code has two stages:
1. The code ask for user input and then makes the calculation (main.py)
2. The code knows the location you are at (it will take Meadville (weather.py)
as the location, but then it can be changed) and makes the computation.

#DESCRIPTION OF MAIN.PY

mainp.py is a simple calculator that calculates the differences
between Celsius and Fahrenheit (there will be an updated version)
of it as well. 

#DESCRIPTION OF WEATHER.PY

Weather.py is a simple program that gets information
based on request from the internet and shows the information
for the user.
